# Lab2 of Computer Network (Honor Class) of PKU
- This is a project of Lab2 of Computer Network (Honor Class) of Peking University. This lab will let us implement a simple TCP-IP protocol stack and implement socket primitive which can communicate with a real linux machine finally. (At present I wish I can achieve this target).
- `code` folder contains all the codes used in my own protocol stack, please refer to `README.md` file in `code` folder for more details; `mperf` folder and `vnetUtils` folder(more detail please refer to `Writeup.md` the official tutorial of this Lab)
- `standard` folder contains some protocal standard which may be referred in the implementation of my protocol.
